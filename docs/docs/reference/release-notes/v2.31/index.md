## Performance improvements

A massive reduction in build speed for local file usage was found in PR [#28891](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28891). This change hugely benefits sites that use markdown and/or images, for up to an 84% improvement on our 128k pages markdown benchmark.

In [#28957](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28957) an improvement to `gatsby develop` was made by not using the `debug` config for `bluebird`. This can improve your `source nodes` step.

## Support for Gatsby's fragments in GraphiQL

The underlying `graphiql` package added support for registering fragments and Gatsby now leverages this new feature! You now get auto-completion for image fragments inside GraphiQL:

## Use Fast Refresh by default for React 17

With the PRs [#28689](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28689) & [#28930](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/28930) merged, Gatsby will now automatically use Fast Refresh if you use React >= 17.0.0 for your site. As you can read in the [release notes for 2.28](/docs/reference/release-notes/v2.28#improved-fast-refresh-integration) we've added support for Fast Refresh giving you a better (and custom) error overlay, quicker error recovery and in general a better `gatsby develop` experience.

Two ESLint rules that will warn you against anti-patterns in your code were added now:

- No anonymous default exports
- Page templates must only export one default export (the page) and `query` as a named export

Please give us your feedback about the Fast Refresh integration in the [umbrella issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/28390). Thanks!
